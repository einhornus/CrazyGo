The game of Go was playing a significant role in Easter Asia countries culture for many years. Meanwhile, it was unknown for Western people until XX century when Go begins to spread over the world. As a result, Go is not very popular in the world except China, Japan and Korea.  
The Asian mindset have one major difference from the Western one: Asian people don't usually consider changing the rules of the traditional games and inventing new ones while in western world it's a common practice: for example, web chess servers have lots of options to play different chess variants. 
As a result, web Go servers don't provide any means to play not the Go itself, but it's variants. Currently, to play Go variants one needs some special equipment and, usually, a third-party referee.  
The subject of the work is the Go client-server application. However, I am going to focus on Go variants functionality to make the novel software product.  
The Go variants I'm going to implement are: 
-One color Go. In this variant of Go players use the stones of the same color. It's usually considered not the variant of Go but some kind of training. Most Go professionals agree that one color Go improves reading skills. 
-Multiplayer Go. The difference from the usual Go is that this game can be played between several opponents, each one placing his individual color stones. However, only one player is considered to be the winner. The main feature of this variant is it involves different kinds of psychology tactics. 
-Hidden move Go. Players place several "hidden" (invisible for the opponent but visible for one) stones before the game starts. In case player selects a spot for the move where the opponent hidden stone is being located, the opponent reveals the hidden stone and the move should be retaken. Because even one stone can change the outcome of the local fight, this Go variant is extremely fun to play and pretty complicated as well.
